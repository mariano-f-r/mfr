Note: this is not a guide of any sort, and isn't intended to thoroughly teach Rust. It is moreso a reflection and perhaps
maybe a little hypetrain. You decide.

# Some Backstory

Like a lot of new programmers in the modern era, I wrote my very first lines of code using the Python programming language.
Honestly, it was great. Things were really simple, and that made programming easy. Anything I thought would work usually
did. And with such a plethora of libraries to work with it meant that basically anything I thought of was possible? Wanna
make a video game? Reach for PyGame. Need a website? Go for Flask, or Django for something heavy duty. I must've made tens 
of things, many of which I thought ridiculously complex. With Python, it seemed like the whole world of computers was at my 
feet.

Seemed. But after a while I realized that the rabbit hole went further. The thing that clued me in was Linux.
See, my very first computer was a cheap Acer Chromebook that was given to me for middle school, and after graduating
middle school, I got into programming. Seeing as my Chromebook could only open webpages, I scoured the web to find out
how I could make it usable for programming. The result was me flashing Linux onto the laptop, and learning it from there.
And after a while of learning how to use a terminal to make commands run, I noticed something: No command had `python3` in 
front of it. This revelation led to some waryness about just how used my trusty sidekick really was. This was only compounded 
by an experience I had over the summer leading into my third year of high school, wherein I attended a summer program where I
learned how to use Swift to make mobile apps.

Swift dazzled me. The combination of seeing a language transcend the janky nature of running Python in an elegant and refined way,
as well as the whole new world of ergonomics that Swift came with built-in, and perhaps chiefly, the now inability to use the hackiness
that Python had afforded me originally (keep this in mind), like mutating global variables inside functions. Clearly, this *was* a 
better horse, albeit seemingly harder to master. 

But I figured it must be worth it, lest nobody use it. That's how the idea came to me to try Rust (since I couldn't use Swift
as I didn't have a Mac). Rust seemed to me to be a faster horse.

# Starting Out

In August of 2022, I downloaded the Rust toolchain. Right off the bat, I could tell that there was something different about Rust.
For starters, the main function is the entry point of the program and the code you want to run must be inside of it (very unremarkable
to the wise amongst you, I'm sure, but 16 year old me knew nothing but Python). And compiling code? To me it was unheard of (Xcode elided
this part of Swift). Already, as someone who was coming from Python, I had seemingly been thrown off the deep end into the real world
of writing code.

The biggest hurdle I faced early on was memory however. Rust has a clever mechanism for managing memory called ownership, wherein each
value in memory has an owner, and may be referenced (many times for reading, but at most once mutably at any given time), but will not 
disappear from memory as long as its owner is in scope. Someone coming from only Python would not understand the previous sentence very 
well however. Memory was a foreign concept to me at the time, and having to learn about things like the stack and the heap was a
new experience and made the language intimidating. But given time, I was slowly able to get a handle on these things, as well as other 
more sophisticated programming features, like interfaces (called traits in Rust), Rust's verbose but expressive syntax, and generics 
(and strong typing in general). 


# More Fundamental Differences

By this point, I was no longer struggling nearly as much with language details. The big differences that I was starting to encounter were
idiomatic. For example, Rust has no Object Oriented Programming, which will seem strange to anyone who has cut their teeth on it. How
do things get represented without classes? What is data like? Rust's answer to this is a total departure from OOP into the paradigm of 
functional programming. Firstly, to deal with representing data, Rust provides algebraic datatypes. These algebraic datatypes, enums and structs, 
are simple, and in some ways similar to classes (especially structs). You can even write methods for them (but they aren't the same as OOP methods
as I'll touch on shortly). The power in these algebraic data types comes in being able to encompass data, and lots of it, well. I'll provide a small 
example.

Here is a domicile, either a house or an apartment, represented in Python:
```python
class Domicile:
  def __init__(self, isApartment, unit_number, floors, address):
    self.apartment = isApartment # true or false
    self.unit_number = unit_number
    self.floors = floors
    self.address =  address
```

A few undesirable things are happening here, namely that houses can be assigned unit numbers, and apartments can have multiple floors. To make it better,
we could use inheritance to define a domicile superclass and make subclasses for apartments and houses, or an interface. Rust has no such need though,
since it can represent the data pretty well at the first go around:


```rust
enum Domicile:
  Apartment {
    unit_number: u16,
    address: String,
  }
  House {
    floors: u8,
    address: String,
  }
}
```

As you can see, Rust has no need to separate things, as by virtue of being able to make enums with members that have fields, we can represent the duality
of domiciles thoroughly, and keep them together because they are domiciles. This even leads to one of Rust's greatest ideas, the inclusion of the monad as
a easy to use language construct. The TL;DR on this is that you can represent a fallible operation as an enum, wherein the operation's value is one variant
of an enum, and the possible error is another. This is a stark departure from other typical programming languages, but compared to exceptions, it forces the
programmer to realize that, no exceptions are not indeed exceptional, errors happen all the time. These enums are so powerful, that Rust even provides
a way to interact with their variants through control flow - the `match` construct, which provides compiler enforced checking of what variant an enum is.
Here it is in action:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
  Ok(T),
  Err(E),
}

let maybe_valid = fallible_operation();

match maybe_valid {
  Ok(real_value) => {
    println!("Got {}", real_value)
  }
  Err(error) => {
    println!("Had error: {}", error);
  }
}
```

So that's data, but what about behavior? Since Rust is indeed a child of functional programming (Ocaml to be precise), it's way of having behavior is similar:
data is transformed or absorbed through functions. Functions are everywhere in Rust. They are such a powerful abstraction, that a lot of times, 
iteration in Rust can be eschewed by reaching for the right standard library endorsed iterator methods.

Speaking of methods, remember how I mentioned how Rust has methods, but they are different? Let me show you a method signature:

```rust
// real function
fn globnicate(target: &mut Glorb, glorp_strength: u32) -> () {
  // --snip--
}

struct Glorb {
  glorb: u32
}

impl Glorb {
  // method
  fn frobnicate(&mut self, glorp_strength: u32) -> () {
    // --snip--
  }
}
```

Notice how it looks like a normal function except it takes self as a parameter? That's because in reality, that's all it really is. The method's in Rust are
just syntactic sugar for functions that operate on instances of the given type. This function also returns something: `()`. What is `()`? It is part of Rust's
rich type system, called the unit value. It is a value with no substance. Rust has another similar type called `!`, or the never type. It is used to represent
return values for functions that never return, like the process exit function. Python certainly doesn't have this.

# Python doesn't have this

Therein lies the biggest obstacle I find when making the switch: the learning curve. When you move from another language to Rust, the thing that is probably the
biggest shock is the new paradigm. Sure, learning new syntax is annoying, but learning a new way to think is just straight up difficult. So difficult, that often
some developers will try to write Rust as they've written other languages. This will fail, and will lead to them to believe that Rust is a bad language. The truth
is that it isn't. Really, if you come to understand Rust's paradigm and grow comfortable with functional programming, Rust provides a great experience
for programming. If.

Specifically when moving from Python to Rust, a lot of hackiness doesn't exist. Things like global variables are frowned upon (and tedious to work with), and casting
things is a somewhat annoying process. The result is that generally, compared to Python, in Rust, you must have a clear idea of how data is flowing through your 
program, whereas in Python you can sort of make things happen, until eventually you have a working program.

Only once you defeat these preconceived notions about how code should be written and accept Rust's version of how the world works, will you be able to write good
clean Rust code (This goes for any programming language really). It was once said that many programming languages make simple things easy, and complex things possible,
whereas Rust makes simple things possible, and complex things easy. I think it's worth the time and the effort.
