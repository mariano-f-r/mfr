I happen to have spent a decent amount of time writing parsers.
A lot of time.
The first time I wrote a parser was when I was working on [vexdoc](https://github.com/mariano-f-r/vexdoc).
It was a relatively simple parser, all it did was parse when the opening and closing format for my documentation format was.

In school, through various recitations and "machine problems", I've spent a not insignificant amount of time writing parsers as well.

The one thing that all of these parsers that I've written have had in common, is that when tackling them, whatever initial 
approach I was using gave way to a better one: the state machine.

# "What is he talking about?"
Happy you should ask! A state machines is a collection of states that can be reached from each other through transitions.

Admittedly such an explanation is almost nonsensical given it's hard to visualize. 
Here's something a bit more tangible from the real world:

![A simple state machine](https://uploads.gamedev.net/monthly_06_2013/ccs-209764-0-84996300-1370053229.jpg)
This is a state machine describing a light switch. A light switch, quite obviously, has two states, on or off 
(unless you are little kid trying to balance the light switch perfectly in the middle, in which case it has three).
From these states, very naturally, there are now transitions. Turning an off light switch on changes the state of the
light to on, and so on. Turning an off light switch off does nothing.

Admittedly, this is a rather plain example, So let's look at a different, more interesting example. 
There is one state machine in particular that has been pervasive in pop culture since the 80s:

![The Mario State Machine](https://www.ashishvishwakarma.com/GoF-Design-Patterns-by-Example/State-Pattern/assets/mario-finite-state-machine.jpg)
Take a look, there's states, and transitions between states. Mario is a state machine.

There are a whole lot of things in the world that can be modeled by state machines, things from traffic lights, to automatic control systems.

# Back to Parsers

As to how parsers can be elegantly represented as state machines, I sort of stumbled on that by accident while working on `vexdoc`.

The premise of how `vexdoc` works is as follows:
1. User writes code
1. User adds special comments denoting significant parts of code
1. User writes some info about these significant parts of code
1. `vexdoc` strips these from the source files and generates some HTML documentation for it 

The format is relatively simple:

```python
#! The Foo Function
"""startsummary
The foo function prints Foo!
endsummary"""
def foo():
  print("Foo!")
# ENDVEXDOC

def bar():
  print("Bar!")
```

Some configuration can be done to use any different language.

The original way I had planned to do this boiled down to the following pseudocode (which admittedly is a bit OCaml-y so bear with me):
```
is_vexdoc = false
is_summary = false
is_source = false

title = ""
summary = ""
source = ""

for line in file
  if line.startsWith "//!"
   title = line
   is_vexdoc = true
  else if line.endsWith "ENDVEXDOC"
    is_vexdoc = false
    writeToHtml title summary source
  else if is_vexdoc && line.endsWith "startsummary"
    is_summary = true

// you see where this is going
```

Gross. It is so hacky and ad-hoc, and would be terrible to maintain.
The basic idea is correct though, the parser needs to transition to doing different things dependent on what it has encountered during the parsing process.

Hmm. Transitions... That's what tipped me off as to what the correct tool for the job is. So then,

# Let's Make a State Machine

The first thing we need to consider to make a state machine is of course, the states.
In the case of `vexdoc` these states directly correspond to what the parser should be doing.

Very obviously, there will be lines where `vexdoc` has nothing to do.
Namely lines that fall outside any documentation blocks should be ignored. Since `vexdoc` shouldn't record anything unless it's in a documentation block,
this state is a natural starting point.

Lines that match a title for a documentation block also represent a state, that of beginning a documentation block.
From there, having another state being reading text inside a summary for a doc-block is only natural
(summmaries make sense only in the context of something to summarize).

The last state we should have is a state for any lines of code after the summary. 

For `vexdoc`, I represented these as a Rust `enum`:
```rust
enum ParserState {
    Ignore,
    Title,
    ItemSummary,
    Code,
}
```

And now to decide our transitions.
These follow rather naturally from our 4 states:
![The vexdoc parser's state machine](/vexdoc-state-machine.png)

And now that this is done, the result can be written as code fairly simply:
```rust
let mut state = ParserState::Ignore;
let mut included = String::new();
for line in file {
  match state {
    ParserState::Ignore => {
      if is_title(line) {
        state = ParserState::Title
        // I'm using build_html so actually making an html component is quite boilerplate-y
        write_as_h1(line);
      }
    }
    ParserState::Title => {
      // since we've already gotten a title, the next line should be the start of the summmary
      if is_summary(line) {
        state = ParserState::ItemSummary;
      } else {
        // the actual user error reporting is better
        return Err("Expected summary")
      }
    }
    ParserState::ItemSummary => {
      if is_summary_end(line) {
        state = ParserState::Code;
        write_as_p(included);
        included.clear();
      } else {
        included += line;
      }
    }
    ParserState::Code => {
      if is_vexdoc_end() {
        state = ParserState::Ignore;
        write_as_pre_code(included);
        included.clear();
      } else {
        included+=line;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Does this seem a bit longer than if we used a bunch of if-statements?
Probably.
Is this more maintainable than those if-statements?
Absolutely.

That's the thing I like most about state-machines.
They are easy to reason about, and it's easy to get data to flow as part of these transitions and states.
In the case of `vexdoc`, data is what drives the transitions, and the behavior is dependent on what state the machine is in.

# To Close

State machines a truly powerful construct, and their usage extends far beyond parsers like the one's I've spent a lot of my time building.
A lot of robotics uses state machines, game developers use state machines for video game AI, compilers and lexers use state machines under the hood.
On top of this, because of their closed nature, they can be mathematically proven, for when maximum precision is required.
So, the next time you see yourself receiving inputs and bouncing back between different behaviors depending on that input, ask yourself:
could I use a state machine?
