A few weeks back, this whole portfolio site was just an idea floating in my head.
I had thought about it a few times during my first University semester, and figured it could be asset in my journey to try and get an internship, as well as giving me my own corner of the web.
Of course, daydreams don't build projects, and nothing came of it for a while.

A few weeks passed, and I decide to go ahead and start tinkering with writing a basic HTML5 page, using CSS and JavaScript to achieve styling and interactivity.
Progress went slowly, and all I got out of it was the idea for the boot-log style loading screen.
I was busy at the time, so seeing a reasonable amount of work result in so little was disheartening to say the least.
I realized that what I wanted would need some form of modern web JavaScript and decent styling (the ReactJSs and TailwindCSSs of the world).
Since I was busy, I declared this to be unfeasible for sometime.

And finally, only in these last few days, did I decide to get building.
I chose Vercel's NextJS and TailwindCSS to get things done, only because they were the first search engine result when looking up ReactJS framework.
And then I just got to work.

One thing that I've learned about me while building all of my projects is that I like jumping off the deep end,
especially when there is well written official documentation. And fortunately, there was.
So now we are here.

Sometimes, just jumping off the deep end gets you results.
